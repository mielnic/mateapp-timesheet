# MateApp Timesheet #

## Summary ##

Timesheet is an application for tracking the allocation of human resources' time. If your organization generates revenue from individuals providing various types of services, Timesheet enables you to quickly access information regarding:

- __Individual Productivity:__ Timesheet helps you understand the workload of both your group and each individual, enabling better support for business decisions.
- __Project Budget Accuracy:__ Most service contracts, whether they are one-time or recurrent, are quoted based on the estimated resources needed to complete the job. Timesheet help you effectively monitor resource and project dedication in relation to each project goal.
- __Customer Profitability:__ Customer relationships are rarely straightforward; they exist in shades of gray. Understanding the nuances of your business history with each customer is crucial for decision-making. Timesheet offers an additional indicator for this purpose: the historical balance of project budget accuracy outcomes for each customer.

Timesheet is built around three principles:

1. __Simple and Trusted Timesheet Logging:__ Work can be reported from any device using an extremely simple and responsive form. The philosophy behind the Timesheet is built on trust, and it does not track people's activities in any manner. Each person reports their time dedication within the timeframe requested by management.

2. __Hour as the Time Unit:__ Timesheet employs the hour as the standard time unit. The hour is a universally accepted unit used in the planning and budgeting of human resources. Therefore, we believe that adding hour fractions in time reporting holds no significance within the application's scope.

3. __Monthly Periods:__ Timesheet utilizes the month as the standard period for analysis.

## Application ##

### Profiles ###

**Every user in the Timesheet application is considered a human resource and is enabled to log hours. However, users are categorized into three profiles:**

- **Standard User:** The standard user utilizes the application solely for logging hours, and they can edit and delete the timesheets generated by themselves.

- **Supervisor User:** In addition to the tasks of a standard user, the supervisor can access management modules. This provides them with the ability to view analyses, create, update, and delete other entities, except for users/resources.

- **Administrator User:** Similar to a supervisor, the administrator has the same tasks and access. Moreover, they can enter the administration module, granting them the capability to create, edit, deactivate, or activate users. They also have access to the system trash, and they can perform and download backups.

### Entities ###

In addition to the user/resource, Timesheet revolves around three main entities:

- **Timesheet:** The timesheet serves as the fundamental unit of the application. It aims to simplify data entry by requesting only essential information: a date, the number of hours, specification of business or non-business hours, and selection of a project from a list. An optional notes field is also provided. Timesheets are logged for the respective user. However, supervisors possess access to a similar creation form within the management/timesheets section, allowing them to generate timesheets for other resources. Consistent with other MateApp applications, constraints are kept to a minimum. Users cannot log future timesheets, but they are free to log timesheets for any project. We believe that for the targeted small organizations, the imposition of resource-to-project management designations entails unnecessary bureaucracy.

- **Projects:** Timesheets are logged under specific projects. Naturally, projects are associated with Customers. These projects can either be one-time or recurring. Each project is allocated a budget in hours (while not obligatory, it holds significance), calculated on a per-project basis for one-time projects and on a monthly basis for recurring ones.

- **Customers:** A customer encompasses any organization to which a project can be assigned. However, direct assignment of timesheets to customers is not supported.

Regarding Users, an essential (though not mandatory) parameter within the user profile can be configured by administrators: the monthly allocation target in hours.

## App Usage ##

### General ###

- Each detail view is equipped with a notes edit button, allowing partial editing of the record (specifically the notes, without editing the entire record).

- Every list view is responsive, meaning it will display fewer columns on smaller screens, such as mobile devices.

- The headers of most list views include a filter/search section. For dates, a dropdown list offers convenient date filtering. Note: Only the "Current Month" and "All" options include items from the current month. All other periods conclude at the last date of the previous month. A text search can be used either independently or in conjunction with date filtering. Form placeholders provide hints about searchable fields in the view.

### Basic Usage ###

Five options are available in in the navigation bar for basic oprations:

- **My Timesheets:** This is a list view of the user's own timesheets. Upon first display, the listed items pertain to the current month. Users can "drill down" (navigate) to projects and customers. However, they can't edit or delete projects or customers, except for the notes in quick edit mode.

- **Log Timesheet:** This option allows users to add timesheets.

- **Trash:** This is the user's trash bin.

- **Profile:** Here, users can edit their basic profile information and change their password.

- **Logout:** Use this option to exit the system.

### Management Module ###

The management menu, available to users with supervisor and administrator privileges, is divided into four sections:

1. **Resources:** This option presents a table listing summarized allocated and unallocated time for each resource in the period defined by the date filtering dropdown. Allocated time is calculated using relevant timesheets, while unallocated time is derived from the Monthly Target specified in the user profile. If the displayed period starts before the resource's join date, unallocated time for that user is calculated from that point onward. A button in the table header allows logging of timesheets for any user. The individual user view can be accessed from the table. User profiles are not editable in this view; only the administration section permits such changes. Additionally, alongside user details, another table summarizes the projects the user has been involved in within the selected date range.

2. **Projects:**  This option displays active projects with summarized allocated time from all users. Inactive (thus completed) projects are omitted to ensure clarity. However, a special keyword, **@inactive**, can be used as a search term to list them. New projects can be created using the button in the table header. The individual project view is accessible through the table. It provides relevant project information, project notes with quick edit capabilities, and a table summarizing resource allocated time for the chosen date range. Full edit and delete options are available from this view, with the delete option enabled only if there are no associated timesheets.

3. **Customers:** This option lists all customers and includes a search form as well as a create button in the table header. The individual customer view, accessible via the table, displays customer information and a calculated value termed **Customer Balance**. Customer balance represents the sum of outcomes from all customer projects by comparing project budgets with actual timesheets allocated to the projects. It considers only finished (inactive) projects or recurring projects up to the previous full month period. A table also showcases this and other information summarized by project. In this case, both inactive and active projects are displayed.

4. **Timesheets:** This view contains all registered (and not deleted) individual or team timesheets. It provides options to search, filter, access each record's view, edit, and eventually delete. 

## Platform ##

### User Registration ###

MateApp employs email addresses as usernames. The email must be both valid and accessible to the user, as it is utilized for user registration and password recovery purposes. MateApp offers the following user registration methods:

- **Manual Registration:** An administrator completes the "Create User" form and provides the user with their login credentials, or, following "best practices", only provides the username email. The user then creates a password through the password recovery utility.

- **Self Registration with "Parking":** Users self-register, but their profiles remain inactive until an administrator manually activates them.

- **Self Registration with Domain Constraint:** For organizations with a registered email domain, self-registration is fully automated, and the user becomes active upon email confirmation. However, only emails from the organization's domain are accepted.

Users registered through these processes are designated as Standard Users. Administerial intervention is always necessary to elevate privileges to the status of a supervisor or administrator.

### Item Deletion ###

MateApp incorporates a trash bin feature. Items deleted by a user are retained in the user's trash until restored or permanently removed. Nevertheless, by default, MateApp never completely erases records. Deleted entries are stored in the Administration Trash of the Administration module. This principle holds for items kept in a user's trash bin as well, facilitating administrator-initiated restoration without requiring access to the user's profile.

## Administration Section ##

The administration section is accessible to authorized users through the curly brackets icon on the left side of the navigation bar.

It comprises three main sections:

- **Backup:** The system retains the five most recent database backups. These backups can be downloaded from the table view. Administrators can generate new backups at any time using the backup dropdown in the navigation bar.

- **Users:** The users section consists of distinct lists for active and inactive users. This is where users can be edited, activated, or inactivated. Additionally, administrators can create new users using the "create" option in the dropdown menu.

- **System Trash:** This section provides a list of discarded items from the entire system. As the application retains this data indefinitely by default, a search utility has been included to help locate older items. Items are sorted according to their trash date.
